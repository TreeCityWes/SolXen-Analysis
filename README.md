# SolXEN Analysis

A Node.js tool for analyzing SolXEN mining transactions and estimating the cost and profitability of mining SolXEN tokens on the Solana blockchain.

## Features

- Fetches recent Solana transactions involving a specific miner program.
- Analyzes mining transaction costs, including compute costs and transaction fees.
- Estimates the profitability of mining SolXEN tokens versus purchasing them from the market.
- Fetches real-time quotes from the Jupiter API for SolXEN swaps.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.16.0 or higher recommended)
- Solana RPC endpoint (you can use [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/) or any other Solana provider)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solxen-analysis.git
cd solxen-analysis
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @solana/web3.js prompt-sync axios colors cli-table3
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```bash
node solxen-analysis.js
```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the AMP value for the analysis.

## Example Output

The script will output various tables summarizing:

- Mining transaction statistics (e.g., total transactions, cost per transaction, hash count).
- Cost analysis of mining versus buying SolXEN.
- Comparison of profitability between mining and purchasing SolXEN from the market.

## Configuration

You can update the RPC endpoint used for querying Solana blockchain data by modifying the `RPC_ENDPOINT` constant in the `solxen-analysis.js` file:

```javascript
const RPC_ENDPOINT = 'https://your-solana-endpoint-url';
```
